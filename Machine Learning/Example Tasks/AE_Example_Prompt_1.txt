Using the constants μ = 3.986004418×10^14 m^3 s^-2 and Earth mean radius R = 6,378.1 km, assume a point mass Earth, circular orbits, no drag, no J2, and instantaneous impulsive burns. Start in a 400 km circular LEO and plan a Hohmann transfer to a 800 km circular orbit. Compute 1 the circular velocity and orbital period at 400 km, 2 the perigee and apogee velocities on the transfer ellipse, 3 the two impulses and the total delta v, and 4 the transfer time. Show formulas and numeric work, report all values in SI units, and round to three significant figures. Restrict yourself to information available as of 9/30/2025/
